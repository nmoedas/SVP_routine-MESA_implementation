1. Add a new hook that creates null functions in the files star data.inc, star data def.inc, and star controls.inc in the star data folder;

2. Create a new hook file/module called other g rad.f90 and add in the mesa makefile for compile in MESA;

3. Add in the control default that this rootinâ€™ is off by default in MESA;

4. In the radiative acceleration root (in the diffusion procs.f90), add a condition to select whether to use the hook or the default routine;

5. Add a condition in the diffusion routine that allows us to turn monochromatic opacity on or off when using SVP. 
MESA by default does not allow the use of radiative accelerations if the monochromatic opacities are not active;

6. Add a folder that contains the SVP routine, and add its directory in the makefile for the models;

7. Finally, recompile/reinstall MESA after making the changes.
